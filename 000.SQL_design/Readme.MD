# Objectives

The goal of this first exercise is to become familiar with database design.

## Survey database design

There are many ways to build a survey database, but let's start by building a basic system with users, questions, responses and votes.

Here are the requirements of our system:

1. A user can create many surveys, but a survey is created by only one user
2. A survey has a question, e.g., "What is your favorite meal?"
3. A survey has many responses, e.g., "Chicken Tandoori","Boeuf Carotte","Coq au vin","Fish and Chips",etc.
4. A user can vote in any survey, but only once, and they can only select one response per survey

### Design the schema

Design a database schema for a survey app that meets the requirements.

For that, your are going to use [SQL Designer](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/)

To submit your solution, save the schema into XML + take a screenshot of your database schema.
