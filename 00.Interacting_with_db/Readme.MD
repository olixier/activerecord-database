# Interacting with a DB (SQLITE)

Sqlite is a simple database that can be used as a standalone file.
If you want more information: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite)

## Objectives

The goal of this first exercie is to use the command line to read and query a sample database called jukebox.sqlite

## Setup

* Open your terminal/console
* Go to the exercice folder

    ````
    cd Lewagon/activerecord-database/
    ````
    
* Test if you have sqlite3 installed on your computer
   
   ````
   sqlite3 -version
   ````
   If not you can download it here [http://www.sqlite.org/download.html](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and follow the instructions to install it.
   

* You can open the database with:

   ````
   sqlite3 db/jukebox.sqlite
   ````

* The you are in the interactive sqlite3 console and your can write queries to the database.

* You can exit the sqlite3 console with ``.quit``

	
## To do

The goal of this exercise is to explore the Jukebox database, and understand its schema.

Answer the following questions: (the resource link can be very helpful!)

* What is the schema of the database? (i.e what are the tables, and the relation between tables)
* Use SQL Design to draw the schema of this database.
* How many rows each table contains?
